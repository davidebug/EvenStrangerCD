The project folder contains 3 folders:
Prototypes --> Will contain the prototypes material we will show the day of the presentation 
		(currently it may still be empty, not visible on Github).
StoryScreeplays --> Will contain all the screenplays and dialogues of the game; 
		as we described our dialogues of the designed level in the LDD document the "Dialogues" folder contains an example only.
Documentation --> Contains all the material we used to write our LDD and DMD document.
